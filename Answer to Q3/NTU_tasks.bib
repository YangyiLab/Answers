abstract = {Lung cancer is the most prevalent cancer worldwide, and histopathological assessment is indispensable for its diagnosis. However, human evaluation of pathology slides cannot accurately predict patients' prognoses. In this study, we obtain 2,186 haematoxylin and eosin stained histopathology whole-slide images of lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 294 additional images from Stanford Tissue Microarray (TMA) Database. We extract 9,879 quantitative image features and use regularized machine-learning methods to select the top features and to distinguish shorter-term survivors from longer-term survivors with stage I adenocarcinoma (P<0.003) or squamous cell carcinoma (P=0.023) in the TCGA data set. We validate the survival prediction framework with the TMA cohort (P<0.036 for both tumour types). Our results suggest that automatically derived image features can predict the prognosis of lung cancer patients and thereby contribute to precision oncology. Our methods are extensible to histopathology images of other organs.},

abstract = {We use deep transfer learning to quantify histopathological patterns across 17,355 hematoxylin and eosin-stained histopathology slide images from 28 cancer types and correlate these with matched genomic, transcriptomic and survival data. This approach accurately classifies cancer types and provides spatially resolved tumor and normal tissue distinction. Automatically learned computational histopathological features correlate with a large range of recurrent genetic aberrations across cancer types. This includes whole-genome duplications, which display universal features across cancer types, individual chromosomal aneuploidies, focal amplifications and deletions, as well as driver gene mutations. There are widespread associations between bulk gene expression levels and histopathology, which reflect tumor composition and enable the localization of transcriptomically defined tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Computational histopathology augments prognosis based on histopathological subtyping and grading, and highlights prognostically relevant areas such as necrosis or lymphocytic aggregates. These findings show the remarkable potential of computer vision in characterizing the molecular basis of tumor histopathology.},

abstract = {Single-cell atlases often include samples that span locations, laboratories and conditions, leading to complex, nested batch effects in data. Thus, joint analysis of atlas datasets requires reliable data integration. To guide integration method choice, we benchmarked 68 method and preprocessing combinations on 85 batches of gene expression, chromatin accessibility and simulation data from 23 publications, altogether representing >1.2 million cells distributed in 13 atlas-level integration tasks. We evaluated methods according to scalability, usability and their ability to remove batch effects while retaining biological variation using 14 evaluation metrics. We show that highly variable gene selection improves the performance of data integration methods, whereas scaling pushes methods to prioritize batch removal over conservation of biological variation. Overall, scANVI, Scanorama, scVI and scGen perform well, particularly on complex integration tasks, while single-cell ATAC-sequencing integration performance is strongly affected by choice of feature space. Our freely available Python module and benchmarking pipeline can identify optimal data integration methods for new data, benchmark new methods and improve method development.},

@article{Friedberg2006,
abstract = {Overwhelmed with genomic data, biologists are facing the first big post-genomic question - What do all genes do? First, not only is the volume of pure sequence and structure data growing, but its diversity is growing as well, leading to a disproportionate growth in the number of uncharacterized gene products. Consequently, established methods of gene and protein annotation, such as homology-based transfer, are annotating less data and in many cases are amplifying existing erroneous annotation. Second, there is a need for a functional annotation which is standardized and machine readable so that function prediction programs could be incorporated into larger workflows. This is problematic due to the subjective and contextual definition of protein function. Third, there is a need to assess the quality of function predictors. Again, the subjectivity of the term 'function' and the various aspects of biological function make this a challenging effort. This article briefly outlines the history of automated protein function prediction and surveys the latest innovations in all three topics. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2006 Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {Visual inspection of histopathology slides is one of the main methods used by pathologists to assess the stage, type and subtype of lung tumors. Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are the most prevalent subtypes of lung cancer, and their distinction requires visual inspection by an experienced pathologist. In this study, we trained a deep convolutional neural network (inception v3) on whole-slide images obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas to accurately and automatically classify them into LUAD, LUSC or normal lung tissue. The performance of our method is comparable to that of pathologists, with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97. Our model was validated on independent datasets of frozen tissues, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and biopsies. Furthermore, we trained the network to predict the ten most commonly mutated genes in LUAD. We found that six of them—STK11, EGFR, FAT1, SETBP1, KRAS and TP53—can be predicted from pathology images, with AUCs from 0.733 to 0.856 as measured on a held-out population. These findings suggest that deep-learning models can assist pathologists in the detection of cancer subtype or gene mutations. Our approach can be applied to any cancer type, and the code is available at https://github.com/ncoudray/DeepPATH.},

Here, we present scGen (https://github.com/theislab/scgen), a model combining variational autoencoders and latent space vector arithmetics for high-dimensional single-cell gene expression data. We show that scGen accurately models perturbation and infection response of cells across cell types, studies and species. In particular, we demonstrate that scGen learns cell-type and species-specific responses implying that it captures features that distinguish responding from non-responding genes and cells. With the upcoming availability of large-scale atlases of organs in a healthy state, we envision scGen to become a tool for experimental design through in silico screening of perturbation response in the context of disease and drug treatment.},

abstract = {Purpose: Analysis of circulating DNA in plasma can provide a useful marker for earlier lung cancer detection. This study was designed to assess the sensitivity and specificity of a quantitative molecular assay of circulating DNA to identify patients with lung cancer and monitor their disease. Materials and Methods: The amount of plasma DNA was determined through the use of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) in 100 non-small-cell lung cancer patients and 100 age-, sex-, and smoking-matched controls. Screening performance of the assay was calculated through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Odds ratios were calculated using conditional logistic regression analysis. Results: Median concentration of circulating plasma DNA in patients was almost eight times the value detected in controls (24.3 v 3.1 ng/mL). The area under the ROC curve was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.907 to 0.973). Plasma DNA was a strong risk factor for lung cancer; concentrations in the upper fertile were associated with an 85-fold higher risk than were those in the lowest fertile. Conclusion: This study shows that higher levels of free circulating DNA can be detected in patients with lung cancer compared with disease-free heavy smokers by a PCR assay, and suggests a new, noninvasive approach for early detection of lung cancer. Levels of plasma DNA could also identify higher-risk individuals for lung cancer screening and chemoprevention trials. {\textcopyright} 2003 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

@article{Wass2008,
abstract = {Motivation: The success of genome sequencing has resulted in many protein sequences without functional annotation. We present ConFunc, an automated Gene Ontology (GO)-based protein function prediction approach, which uses conserved residues to generate sequence profiles to infer function. ConFunc split sets of sequences identified by PSI-BLAST into sub-alignments according to their GO annotations. Conserved residues are identified for each GO term sub-alignment for which a position specific scoring matrix is generated. This combination of steps produces a set of feature (GO annotation) derived profiles from which protein function is predicted. Results: We assess the ability of ConFunc, BLAST and PSI-BLAST to predict protein function in the twilight zone of sequence similarity. ConFunc significantly outperforms BLAST & PSI-BLAST obtaining levels of recall and precision that are not obtained by either method and maximum precision 24% greater than BLAST. Further for a large test set of sequences with homologues of low sequence identity, at high levels of presicision, ConFunc obtains recall six times greater than BLAST. These results demonstrate the potential for ConFunc to form part of an automated genomics annotation pipeline. {\textcopyright} The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press.

Halicin also effectively treated Clostridioides difficile and pan-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections in murine models. Additionally, from a discrete set of 23 empirically tested predictions from >107 million molecules curated from the ZINC15 database, our model identified eight antibacterial compounds that are structurally distant from known antibiotics.

Besides, pathologists' estimates do not correlate well with genomic tumor purity values, which are inferred from genomic data and accepted as accurate for downstream analysis. We developed a deep multiple instance learning model predicting tumor purity from H&E-stained digital histopathology slides. Our model successfully predicted tumor purity in eight The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts and a local Singapore cohort. The predictions were highly consistent with genomic tumor purity values. Thus, our model can be utilized to select samples for genomic analysis, which will help reduce pathologists' workload and decrease inter-observer variability.

abstract = {Background: Previous approaches to defining subtypes of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and other cancers based on transcriptomes have assumed the existence of discrete subtypes. We analyze gene expression patterns of colorectal tumors from a large number of patients to test this assumption and propose an approach to identify potentially a continuum of subtypes that are present across independent studies and cohorts. Results: We examine the assumption of discrete CRC subtypes by integrating 18 published gene expression datasets and > 3700 patients, and contrary to previous reports, find no evidence to support the existence of discrete transcriptional subtypes. Using a meta-analysis approach to identify co-expression patterns present in multiple datasets, we identify and define robust, continuously varying subtype scores to represent CRC transcriptomes. The subtype scores are consistent with established subtypes (including microsatellite instability and previously proposed discrete transcriptome subtypes), but better represent overall transcriptional activity than do discrete subtypes. The scores are also better predictors of tumor location, stage, grade, and times of disease-free survival than discrete subtypes. Gene set enrichment analysis reveals that the subtype scores characterize T-cell function, inflammation response, and cyclin-dependent kinase regulation of DNA replication. Conclusions: We find no evidence to support discrete subtypes of the CRC transcriptome and instead propose two validated scores to better characterize a continuity of CRC transcriptomes.},
